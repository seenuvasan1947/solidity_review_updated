## About

This will be the first in a series of First Flights featuring move on Aptos!

### This challenge teaches several important security concepts:

- How Move handles ownership 
- Understanding how Move handles account authentication differently from Solidity
- Global storage vs contract storage
- Resource safety implications
- Event emission patterns

SecretVault is a Move smart contract application for storing a secret on the Aptos blockchain. Only the owner should be able to store a secret and then retrieve it later. Others should not be able to access the secret.

### Roles
Owner - Only the owner may set and retrieve their secret
