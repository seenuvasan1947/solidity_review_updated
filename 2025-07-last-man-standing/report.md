# High Issues

## H-1: ETH transferred without address checks

Consider introducing checks for `msg.sender` to ensure the recipient of the money is as intended.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 256](src/Game.sol#L256)

	```solidity
	    function withdrawWinnings() external nonReentrant {
	```

</details>



## H-2: Reentrancy: State change after external call

Changing state after an external call can lead to re-entrancy attacks.Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern to avoid this issue.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 260](src/Game.sol#L260)

	State is changed at: `pendingWinnings[msg.sender] = 0`
	```solidity
	        (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: amount}("");
	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>6 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 6](src/Game.sol#L6)

	```solidity
	contract Game is Ownable {
	```

- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 272](src/Game.sol#L272)

	```solidity
	    function resetGame() external onlyOwner gameEndedOnly {
	```

- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 289](src/Game.sol#L289)

	```solidity
	    function updateGracePeriod(uint256 _newGracePeriod) external onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 303](src/Game.sol#L303)

	```solidity
	    ) external onlyOwner isValidPercentage(_newFeeIncreasePercentage) {
	```

- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 316](src/Game.sol#L316)

	```solidity
	        onlyOwner
	```

- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 327](src/Game.sol#L327)

	```solidity
	    function withdrawPlatformFees() external onlyOwner nonReentrant {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Unspecific Solidity Pragma

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 2](src/Game.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```

</details>



## L-3: Public Function Not Used Internally

If a function is marked public but is not used internally, consider marking it as `external`.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 343](src/Game.sol#L343)

	```solidity
	    function getRemainingTime() public view returns (uint256) {
	```

- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 357](src/Game.sol#L357)

	```solidity
	    function getContractBalance() public view returns (uint256) {
	```

</details>



## L-4: Literal Instead of Constant

Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals. If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

<details><summary>5 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 136](src/Game.sol#L136)

	```solidity
	        require(_percentage <= 100, "Game: Percentage must be 0-100.");
	```

- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 166](src/Game.sol#L166)

	```solidity
	        require(_feeIncreasePercentage <= 100, "Game: Fee increase percentage must be 0-100.");
	```

- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 167](src/Game.sol#L167)

	```solidity
	        require(_platformFeePercentage <= 100, "Game: Platform fee percentage must be 0-100.");
	```

- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 199](src/Game.sol#L199)

	```solidity
	        currentPlatformFee = (sentAmount * platformFeePercentage) / 100;
	```

- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 218](src/Game.sol#L218)

	```solidity
	        claimFee = claimFee + (claimFee * feeIncreasePercentage) / 100;
	```

</details>



## L-5: `nonReentrant` is Not the First Modifier

To protect against reentrancy in other modifiers, the `nonReentrant` modifier should be the first modifier in the list of modifiers.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 188](src/Game.sol#L188)

	```solidity
	    function claimThrone() external payable gameNotEnded nonReentrant {
	```

- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 327](src/Game.sol#L327)

	```solidity
	    function withdrawPlatformFees() external onlyOwner nonReentrant {
	```

</details>



## L-6: PUSH0 Opcode

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 2](src/Game.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```

</details>



## L-7: Modifier Invoked Only Once

Consider removing the modifier or inlining the logic into the calling function.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 124](src/Game.sol#L124)

	```solidity
	    modifier gameEndedOnly() {
	```

</details>



## L-8: State Variable Could Be Immutable

State variables that are only changed in the constructor should be declared immutable to save gas. Add the `immutable` attribute to state variables that are only changed in the constructor

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 22](src/Game.sol#L22)

	```solidity
	    uint256 public initialGracePeriod; // The grace period set at the start of a new game round
	```
